description: Guided SOP for setting up and using OpenMAIC from OpenClaw. Use when the user wants to clone the OpenMAIC repo, choose a startup mode, configure recommended API keys, start the service, or generate a classroom from requirements or a PDF. Run one phase at a time and ask for confirmation before each state-changing step.

# OpenMAIC Skill

Use this as a guided, confirmation-heavy SOP. Do not compress the whole setup into one reply and do not perform state-changing actions without explicit user confirmation.

## Core Rules

- Move one phase at a time.
- Before any state-changing action, ask for confirmation.
- If local state already exists, show what you found and ask whether to keep it.
- Do not assume the OpenClaw agent's own model or API key will be reused by OpenMAIC.
- OpenMAIC classroom generation uses OpenMAIC server-side provider config.
- This skill must not rely on any request-time model or provider overrides.
- Only OpenMAIC server-side config files may control provider selection and defaults.
- Do not default to asking the user to paste API keys into chat.
- Prefer guiding the user to edit local config files themselves.
- Do not offer to write API keys into config files on the user's behalf.
- Once setup is complete and the user clearly asks to generate a classroom, do not ask for a second confirmation before submitting the generation job.
- Keep confirmations for local file reads such as reading a PDF from disk.

## Optional Skill Config

If present, read defaults from `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` under:

```jsonc
{
  "skills": {
    "entries": {
      "openmaic": {
        "enabled": true,
        "config": {
          "accessCode": "sk-xxx",
          "repoDir": "/path/to/OpenMAIC",
          "url": "http://localhost:3000"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

- If `accessCode` is present, default to hosted mode and skip the mode-selection prompt.
- Use `repoDir` and `url` only as defaults for local mode.
- Still confirm before acting.

## SOP Phases

### 0. Choose Mode

First check skill config for `accessCode`. If present, announce that a stored access code was found and proceed directly to hosted mode (load [references/hosted-mode.md](references/hosted-mode.md), skip phases 1–4). Do not ask the user to paste the code again.

If no `accessCode` in config, ask the user how they want to use OpenMAIC:

1. **Use hosted OpenMAIC** (recommended for quick start) — Requires an access code from open.maic.chat. No local setup needed.
2. **Run locally** — Clone the repo, configure provider keys, and run on your machine.

If the user chooses hosted mode, load [references/hosted-mode.md](references/hosted-mode.md) and skip phases 1–4.
If the user chooses local mode, proceed to phase 1 as usual.

### 1. Clone Or Reuse Existing Repo

Load [references/clone.md](references/clone.md).

Use this when the user has not installed OpenMAIC yet or when you need to confirm which local checkout to use.

### 2. Choose Startup Mode

Load [references/startup-modes.md](references/startup-modes.md).

Use this after the repo location is confirmed. Present the available startup modes, recommend one, and wait for the user's choice.

### 3. Configure Provider Keys

Load [references/provider-keys.md](references/provider-keys.md).

Use this before starting classroom generation. Recommend a provider path and tell the user exactly which config file to edit themselves. If generation later fails due to provider/model/auth issues, return to this phase and direct the user to update the same server-side config files.

After the core LLM key is configured, ask the user if they want to enable optional features (web search, image generation, video generation, TTS). Each requires its own provider key — see the "Optional Features" section in provider-keys.md.

### 4. Start And Verify OpenMAIC

After the user has chosen a startup mode and configured keys, start OpenMAIC using the chosen method, then verify the service with `GET {url}/api/health`.

### 5. Generate A Classroom

Load [references/generate-flow.md](references/generate-flow.md).

Use this only after the service is healthy. Confirm before reading local PDFs. If the user has already clearly asked to generate, do not ask for a second confirmation before submitting the generation job, and then follow the polling loop until it succeeds or fails. Only send the supported content fields for generation requests. For long-running jobs, prefer sparse polling and tell the user to check back later if the turn ends before completion.

## Response Style

- Keep each step short and explicit.
- Prefer 2-3 concrete options when the user must choose.
- Always include the recommended option first and explain why in one sentence.
- After a step completes, say what changed and what the next confirmation is for.
- When returning a classroom link, place the raw absolute URL on its own line with no bold, markdown link syntax, code formatting, or tables.
